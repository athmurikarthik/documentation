1)initailly import necessary libraries.
2)import necessary layers in tensorflow.
3)by creating empty list to append the images which are converted to 512,512 ie., new_data.
4)due to unsupervised data there is no labels for data so data has to split for training purpose for that x_train &x_test.
5)for training data has to be resized.
6)model has to setup with encoders & decoders with respective layers so that I have used conv2D,maxpooling2D,upsampling2D and activation funtion relu and sigmoid.
7)model compilation Adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy.
8)for training batch_size and epochs has to be mentioned they has to be clusterd by kmeans clustering.
9)visualise the trained data sacatter diagram.
10)model has to be fit to trained data and visualise them.
11)predict the result with x_test.
12)to extact the similar images in the model by cosine similarity funtion, to visualise co-variance use heatmap.
